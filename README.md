# Void-dots [Inactive]

This repository is currently inactive as, for the time being, I have no interest in Void Linux. Its files will remain here for archival purposes only.


Void Linux dot files. They are specially configured to work on my desktop environment, which is a hybrid between the Xfce desktop environment and the i3-gaps window manager. One may call it Xi3-gaps.
